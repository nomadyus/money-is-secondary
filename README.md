# Money Is Secondary
A simple javascript adventure 2D platform game that shows the fun side of money.

## Requirements
This simple game uses the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the platform to build the game engine and logic.

## Idea
This is a runner type game. User plays as a character that is running through a cityscape (ranging from high altitude high-rise to street level to underground tunnel). Character is running with a case (backpack or suitcase). The case is filled with money and the character collects more money through the run sequence. However, whenever character picks up more money the speed of the character drastically reduces. By getting rid of the money the character gains momentary boost in speed and agility which lasts as much as the amount of money collected.
